## 🚀 **What You Can Build Now**

With your intermediate hooks mastery, you can build:

### **Complex Applications**
- **E-commerce Sites** - Shopping carts, product filtering, user management
- **Dashboard Apps** - Data visualization, real-time updates, complex forms
- **Chat Applications** - Message management, user state, real-time features
- **Game Applications** - Game state, score tracking, player management

### **Performance-Optimized Apps**
- **Large Lists** - Efficiently rendered with useCallback + React.memo
- **Data-Heavy Apps** - Optimized calculations with useMemo
- **Interactive UIs** - Smooth animations and responsive interfaces
- **Real-time Apps** - Efficient state updates and minimal re-renders

## 🎓 **Key Insights You've Gained**

### **When to Use Each Hook**

#### **useReducer vs useState**
- **useState:** Simple, independent state values
- **useReducer:** Complex state with multiple related values and actions

#### **useCallback vs useMemo**
- **useCallback:** Memoize functions (for React.memo optimization)
- **useMemo:** Memoize values (for expensive calculations)

#### **useRef vs useState**
- **useState:** Values that should trigger re-renders and appear in UI
- **useRef:** Values that persist but don't trigger re-renders

### **Performance Optimization Strategy**
1. **Measure First** - Use React DevTools Profiler
2. **Identify Bottlenecks** - Find unnecessary re-renders
3. **Apply Hooks** - useCallback, useMemo, React.memo
4. **Measure Again** - Verify improvements
